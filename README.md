Reflection Questions
If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.
During this prework I did utilize some slack help from codepath individuals with some experience working with this glitch application. I used w3schools.com as a tool to understand the math.random function better and also how to work with arrays with arrays in Javascript.

What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)
An issue that I came across when I was working on this pre-work was that I would feel a bit intimidated when I came across a requirement or question. When I first started working on the pre-work I didnâ€™t feel confident about working with CSS or HTML or Javascript, but after fiddling around with it and giving it a solid try I came to understand that it was not as hard as I thought it was and it also gave me confidence. I had fun figuring out the ectra requirement question that required the use of Math.random. I new I could implement it in a way to choose from a number from 1 to 5 for the 5 buttons that I had within my game application. I then how to figure out how to make it choose within a number array and then also have the ability to adjust the array length to my own liking. Figuring out how to do that was interesting and amazing process. I was actually surprised when it worked because I had errors with it and I made sure to check it properly after implementing it. Also the idea of calling it within the startGame function was a great hint and helped me out. I made the pattern variable equal to my function that would make a random pattern everytime we called upon the pattern variable.

What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)
I would be interested in working with web development in the future. I am interested right now in what the back end development looks like at the professional level and how the backend would like for when an application is being built. What technologies are used in the industry when doing website development? I also would love to know about common problems others in website development deal with. I noticed there is a lot of front end coding where you do try to make your website look interesting to the customer, what level of expertise to you need in design to make a design front end for your website?

If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)
If I had a bit more time with this pre-work I would focus on the extra requirement that would wind down the pause time inbetween the clues so that it caused the user to speed up. That would have been amazing to try to figure out and work out. Because I know would have to be careful with the length of my pattern when the pausetime lessens and lessens as the clues keep coming. I also would need tobe aware of how much time I would be shaving off for each clue because it would still require that my game be playable with the pause time running down. I would also love to have given three chances instead of one to lose the game, I am sure implementing that would be a fun challenge.
